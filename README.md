This repository contains a **fully custom RISC-V System-on-Chip (SoC)**
The design is based on the **CV32E40P industrial-grade RISC-V core** from the **OpenHW Group** and is implemented entirely in **pure SystemVerilog (RTL)**.

Unlike conventional FPGA designs that rely on Vivado IP Integrator, Block Automation, or proprietary IPs, this project intentionally avoids pre-built IP cores to demonstrate **full architectural control**, **protocol-level understanding**, and **cycle-accurate system design**.

## 🧩 High-Level Architecture

The system is designed to overcome the Von Neumann bottleneck by employing a split-bus topology. Key architectural components include:

### 1. Custom Interconnect (Split Decoders)
Instead of a standard AXI Crossbar, the system uses two specialized decoders to maximize performance:
* **Instruction Decoder:** A purely combinational block with **Zero-Latency**. It routes instruction fetch requests from the CPU directly to Boot ROM or Instruction RAM immediately.
* **Data Decoder:** An FSM-based block that handles Load/Store operations. It manages the handshake logic for slower peripherals (UART, Flash) and variable-latency memories.

### 2. Dual-Port Instruction RAM
To enable the bootloader to load the application code into the execution memory, the Instruction RAM utilizes a **Dual-Port Block RAM** architecture:
* **Port A (Read-Only):** Connected to the CPU Instruction Fetch interface.
* **Port B (Write-Only):** Connected to the Data Bus. This allows the CPU to write instructions into memory as data during the boot process.

### 3. Peripheral Subsystem
All peripherals are memory-mapped starting at `0x1000_0000`. A wrapper module performs address decoding and routes transactions to:
* **GPIO:** Controls LEDs and reads Switches.
* **Timer:** Provides a system tick and cycle counting.
* **UART:** Handles serial communication for debugging.
* **Custom QSPI Master:** A bit-banged SPI engine designed to interface with the **mx25l3273f** (Macronix) Flash memory.

| Region | Base Address | Size | Access | Description |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **Boot ROM** | `0x0000_0000` | 512 B | R | Reset Vector & Hardcoded FSBL |
| **Instruction RAM** | `0x0010_0000` | 8 KB | R/W | Main Application Memory (Executable) |
| **Data RAM** | `0x0020_0000` | 8 KB | R/W | Stack, Heap, and Variables |
| **GPIO** | `0x1000_0000` | 256 B | R/W | LED & Switch Control |
| **Timer** | `0x1000_1000` | 256 B | R/W | System Timer |
| **UART** | `0x1000_2000` | 256 B | R/W | Serial Communication |
| **QSPI** | `0x1000_4000` | 256 B | R/W | External Flash Controller |

## 🔄 Boot Sequence (How the System Starts)

The system does not have an OS. It uses a bare-metal boot sequence verified on hardware:

1.  **Reset:** The CPU comes out of reset and fetches the first instruction from `0x0000_0000` (Boot ROM).
2.  **QSPI Initialization:** The FSBL code initializes the Custom QSPI Master registers.
3.  **Polling Loop:** The software polls the hardware `BUSY_FLAG` (mapped to `0x1000_4028`) to synchronize data transfer from the slower Flash memory.
4.  **Endianness Correction:** The QSPI hardware automatically swaps bytes to Little-Endian format for the RISC-V CPU before presenting data.
5.  **Copy Operation:** The CPU reads instructions from External Flash (starting at offset **0x0030_0000**) and writes them into the **Instruction RAM** (at **0x0010_0000**) via the Data Bus.
6.  **Jump to Application:** Once copying is complete, the Bootloader executes a `jalr` instruction to `0x0010_0000`, transferring control to the main application. This is physically confirmed by the **0xAA (10101010) LED pattern**.
